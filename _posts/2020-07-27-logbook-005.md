Back to Business As Usual.
{:.figure}


I have been out for last weeks as I have been fighting with personal issues
 (hospitals, birthdays, and the anxiety of the quarantine), and with work
 staff.  I have recently moved to a new company called OneClick, a spanish
 company focused on transforming the education of all K12 students by helping
 educational publishers to understand new technologies and innovation.

I have joined as cloud engineer and DevOps evangelist.  I must admit that I'm
 happy and I feel this is my place.  A great place to work passionately.

My kid is back at home just in time to celebrate his birthday, so we have been
 able to breath and relax.

I'm still learning piano, but I haven't practice daily (my bad).  I need to get
 serious with my classes.  I don't want to get September with the course
 unfinished.

This week is going to be very hot, it's Monday and weather scores 30-39º Celsius.
