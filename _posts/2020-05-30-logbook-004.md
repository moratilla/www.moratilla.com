title: Logbook - 004 bad week at hospital (part 2)

Hey! if the last week was bad, this one is worse.  Project took to much effort,
 my youngest kid complained and I was in middle again of work - family concile
 trouble.  Hi anxiety, back so soon?

Well, I decided to finish the project in time, but I know I have left
 documentation to do.  But now that it is released, I'm going to focus on my
 family.

The situation is that my elder kid has been very down again.  Not pulse, but
 other stuff.  He has no infection traces or indicators, but his mood is worse
 than ever. He is practically absent and does not interact with anybody.

So, life is stopped until he gets fine and we can keep living again.
